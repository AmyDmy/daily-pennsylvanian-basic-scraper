# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on [ 2/24/2025 ]

```
[User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /]
```

## Explanation

[ The file specifies that all user agents (bots) are allowed to access the entire website (`Allow: /`), but they must observe a crawl delay of 10 seconds between requests to avoid overloading the server. However, the file explicitly disallows the SemrushBot from accessing any content (`Disallow: /`). This means that if you are using a bot that identifies itself differently than SemrushBot, you are permitted to scrape the site as long as you adhere to the 10-second delay rule. ]
